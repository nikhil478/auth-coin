## Milestones

The first milestone is to implement this on the BSV blockchain, followed by BTC, BCH, Fractal Bitcoin, and Eartbucks.

To begin, I plan to contribute to the BSV blockchain by creating a library in Go. Go is an ideal choice for this project due to its support for concurrency, high performance, and the mature ecosystem of BSV libraries already built on Go. These features make Go well-suited for developing scalable and efficient solutions within the BSV ecosystem.

The entire concept will be open source, allowing anyone to integrate it. For any inquiries or questions, feel free to reach out at nikhilmatta10@gmail.com.
