## Milestones

My first milestone is to achieve this on the BSV blockchain, followed by BTC, BCH, Fractal Bitcoin, and Earthucks.

Initially, I plan to contribute to the BSV blockchain by developing a library in Go. I believe Go is the most efficient choice for this task due to its support for concurrency, speed, and the mature ecosystem of BSV libraries built on top of Go. This makes Go an ideal language for building scalable and high-performance solutions within the BSV ecosystem.
